# Using PL/Java with SELinux

These notes were made running PostgreSQL and PL/Java on a Red Hat system,
but should be applicable--with possible changes to details--on other systems
running SELinux.

Anything that gets run by `postgres` itself runs under a special SELinux context
with type `postgresql_t` that severely limits things it can do.  This is
generally good.

## File contexts

SELinux may prevent it from opening important files, such as
`libpljava-[version].so` or `pljava-[version].jar`, depending
on the SELinux contexts set on those files. The contexts can be
listed using `ls -Z`.

The exact SELinux rules being applied, and the file contexts they
would allow, can be different. For example, a `.so` file is considered
executable and triggers one kind of rule, while to SELinux a `.jar` file
is just an ordinary file that Java is trying to open.

Whether a failure is being caused by SELinux can be determined by
searching the system log for `avc denied` messages. If that is the
problem, it can be solved in more than one way. For example:

* Search the system's existing SELinux policy (using [apol][] or
    [sesearch][], perhaps) to find the rules that apply to what
    the program is trying to do, and what target contexts *would be*
    allowed, then use [chcon][] to set one of those contexts on the
    file in question. For example, on a Red Hat box, changing the
    context type on `libpljava-[version].so` to `lib_t` and on
    `pljava-[version].jar` to `usr_t` did the trick.
* Write and load a new [SELinux policy module][sepolmod] with rules
    that allow the needed operations.

### Issues requiring policy modules

Something in the JVM uses the `sched_get{param,priority,scheduler}` system
calls, so a process of type `postgresql_t` has to be given the `getsched`
SELinux permission. Also, for SSL connections to work, access to the
`random_device` needs to be allowed. Both of these rules can be added in
a policy module:

```
policy_module(mod-pljava, 1.0)

require {
    type postgresql_t;
    type random_device_t;
}

allow postgresql_t postgresql_t : process { getsched };
allow postgresql_t random_device_t : chr_file { getattr };
```

If that is placed in a file `pljava.te` then

    make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile
    semodule -i pljava.pp

will build and install it.

As another example, suppose a PL/Java function needs to make an `ssh`
connection to a remote host. In the default policy, nothing running as
`postgresql_t` is allowed to connect network sockets to remote `ssh` ports.
Again, a policy module can do the trick:

```
policy_module(mod-pgsql-ssh, 1.0)

require {
    type postgresql_t;
    type ssh_port_t;
}

allow postgresql_t ssh_port_t : tcp_socket { name_connect };
```

As it stands, this is quite broad, and would allow connections to the `ssh`
port at _any_ remote address, exactly what the SELinux policy was trying
to prevent. It is reportedly possible (if fiddly) to allow only connecting
to the `ssh` port on the _intended_ remote machine, using the right
[melange of SELinux and iptables][melange].

## How to break things

One of the best ways to cause a PL/Java installation to stop working, after
being trouble-free for ages, is to replace or update one of the files it
depends on, and forget to reapply the needed SELinux context to the file.
